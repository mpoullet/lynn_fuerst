PROGRAM DISK

This disk contains one file - LYNN.EXE.  This file is a self-extracting archive 
that requires Microsoft Windows 3.1x or 95 in order to run (if you do not have 
Microsoft Windows on your PC please see the NOTE at the end of this section).  
Simply run the file, either by selecting RUN from the FILE menu (Windows 3.1x) 
or by selecting RUN from the START Menu (Windows 95).  The filename is

A:\LYNN.EXE

The installation routine will give you the option to specify where you wish the 
files to be installed on your hard-disk.

When installed there will be a directory on your hard-disk that contains source 
programs in C and PASCAL, and compiled programs in C, with  extensions .C, .PAS, 
and .EXE respectively.  Each program has a file name of the form DSPnn, where nn 
refers to the program number between 1 and 29.  Thus DSP07.EXE refers to the 
compiled C-version of Program no. 7, and so on.

The C programs were compiled using Borland Turbo C++ 3.0.  To run properly, the 
files with an extension of .BGI should be copied to the same directory as the 
program files.


NOTE

If you do not have Microsoft Windows on your PC you can still access the files.  
You will need to decompress the file LYNN.EXE using an application such as 
PKUNZIP.  The command line is as follows:

		pkunzip a:\lynn.exe
